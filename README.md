SportsNewsDemo
==============

A demo news reader that uses the ESPN API
-----------------------------------------

This demo tabbed application presents sports news from the ESPN API. The first tab shows top news headlines while in the second tab the user can track individual teams. A modal view allows the user to manage their favorite teams. The news headlines and content are fetched through API calls while favorite teams are persisted in Core Data. The app uses the AFNetworking 2.0 library to handle networks requests.
